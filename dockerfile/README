# Intro
Application built in Python 3.8.1 and hosted in Flask that allows you to find the servers external IP address without visiting a site like whatsmyipaddress or canhazip

# Running
use the following command to run the image

`docker run -dit -p 8080:8080 screamingjoypad/flask-ipfinder`

This will run the server automatically on port 8080 on localhost.

For your own system, visit something like 0.0.0.0:8080 or if you're hosting this on another server then visit <serveripaddress>:8080
